# TinyApp

This app displays an image with a caption, and lets the user click a button
to view that image full screen. From the full screen mode, tapping on the image
will make a back button appear that takes the user back to the main view.

This app runs on android version 6.0 and up.

I referenced this stackoverflow question to learn how to link a button to change a view
